Basics

How do we create an object?
	The same way that we would with simple jquery object, 
	person1 = new Person();

How do we get object property values?
	You can access these objects with .get('attribute')

How do we set though attributes?
	You can set in 2 ways:
		1. .set('attribute', value);
			This is typically used for a single setter
		2. .set({attribute: value});
			This is usually used when setting multiple attributes at a time


Validation
	
How do we setup validation
	Model validation is now only enforced by default in Model#save and no longer enforced by default upon construction or in Model#set, unless the {validate:true} option is passed.

	person.set({ age: -100 }, { validate: true });

How do we fetch the errors returned in the validate model?
	person.on("error", funtion(model, error) {
		console.log(error);
	});
