Basics

How do we get object property values?
You can access these objects with .get('attribute')

How do we set though attributes?
You can set in 2 ways:
	1. .set('attribute', value);
		This is typically used for a single setter
	2. .set({attribute: value});
		This is usually used when setting multiple attributes at a time
